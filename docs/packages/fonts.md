# Fonts

This package may come in handy if you decide to extend Nanc with your own fonts. To do this, you need to install the `fonts` package, as indicated below, in your Nanc build application, and then set the required parameters for the added fonts using the `CustomFont` class in the launch configuration. More about this in the [configuration section](/docs/nanc_configuring).

## Import

```yaml
dependencies:
  fields:
    path: ../nanc/fields
```
