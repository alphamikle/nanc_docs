# Config

This package contains the configurations used when running Nanc, and you can also customize some aspects of the CMS by passing environment variables:

`ERROR_DURATION=<int>` - specifies, in seconds, the time for which an error message will be shown

`SIMPLE_ERRORS=<bool>` - specifies whether detailed error messages or only human-readable headers will be shown
