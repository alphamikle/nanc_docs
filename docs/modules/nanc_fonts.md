# Nanc fonts

This package may come in handy if you decide to extend Nanc with your own fonts. To do this, you need to install the `nanc_fonts` package, as indicated below, in your Nanc build application, and then set the required parameters for the added fonts using the `CustomFont` class in the launch configuration. More about this in the [configuration section](../cms_configuration.md).

## Import

Install it from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/nanc_fonts):

```yaml
dependencies:
  nanc_fonts: any
```
